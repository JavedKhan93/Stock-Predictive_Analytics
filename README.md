An end-to-end data analytics and predictive modeling project that analyzes 10+ years of stock market data (2014–2024) to uncover trends, visualize insights, and predict future stock prices using Machine Learning and LSTM deep learning models.


📂 Dataset: Historical Stock Market Data (2014–2024)
🧠 Model: Trained LSTM (.h5)

✨ Key Features

📊 Long-Term Market Analysis
Analyzes over a decade of stock market data to identify trends, cycles, and volatility patterns.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handles missing values, scaling, feature selection, and time-series sequence generation.

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizes stock prices, moving averages, daily returns, and volume trends.

📉 Technical Indicators
Implements indicators like Simple & Exponential Moving Averages to understand price momentum.

🤖 Machine Learning Models
Builds baseline regression models for performance comparison.

🧠 Deep Learning with LSTM
Uses Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture long-term dependencies in time-series data.

📐 Model Evaluation
Evaluates predictions using RMSE, MAE, and actual vs predicted price plots.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming: Python

Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn
